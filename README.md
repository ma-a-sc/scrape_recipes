Two basic parsers to get the recipes from cookbooks.com and food.com.

Wanted to use the recipes for an app before I noticed I will run into copyright issues.
Recipes on their own are not protected by the copyright law but a whole corpus like the two websites are.
Hence, these parsers are no good and only viable for personal projects or an NLP project or similar, but not any app that will then reuse the scraped recipes.
